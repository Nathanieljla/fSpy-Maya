1. Under your documents/maya folder create a new folder called modules (If you don't see one)
2. Unzip the contents to the modules folder.
3. Confirm that you now have:
    A folder here -> Documents\maya\modules\fSpy_maya
    A document here -> Documents\maya\modules\fSpy_maya.mod

4. Launch Maya.
5. Make sure the plug-in is loaded via the plug-in manager (windows menu > Setting and preferences > Plug-in Manager)
    You can search for fspy to quickly locate the plug-in
